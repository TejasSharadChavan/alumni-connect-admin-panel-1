## Implementation Status

Due to the complexity and scope of a complete social media feed redesign, I recommend:

1. **Phase 1** (Immediate): Fix critical bugs in existing feed
2. **Phase 2** (Next): Add image upload to cloud storage
3. **Phase 3** (Future): Add real-world events integration

The current feed file is 895 lines and needs careful refactoring to avoid breaking existing functionality.

## Next Steps
